    <p1>
    I was born and raised in Athens, GA, and after high school I soon moved to 
    Atlanta to attend Georgia Tech. After graduating with a degree in business,
    I eventually got a job in Norcross working to price maintenance contracts for 
    enterprise hardware such as servers and networking devices. Four years later, 
    I decided I was bored enough to try something new and GT Coding Boot Camp seemed
    like a good way to get a fresh start. In my spare time I like walking my dog, watching sports,
    especially NBA and the NFL, spending countless hours on my computer, and playing video games.
